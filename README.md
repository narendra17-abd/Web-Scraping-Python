Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves fetching and parsing HTML content from web pages to extract useful information. 
Python is a popular programming language for web scraping due to its simplicity and the availability of powerful libraries.

# Understanding HTML:

# Fetching HTML Content:
Use the requests library to send an HTTP request to a website and retrieve its HTML content.

# Parsing HTML:
